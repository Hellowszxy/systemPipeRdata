Description: systemPipeRdata is a helper package to generate with a single command NGS workflow templates for the parent package systemPipeR. The latter is an environment for building end-to-end analysis pipelines with automated report generation for next generation sequence (NGS) applications such as RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, VAR-Seq and many others. Detailed examples for using systemPipeRdata are given in systemPipeR's overview vignette.
