Description: systemPipeRdata is a data package that facilitates the generation of NGS workflow templates for its parent package systemPipeR. The latter is an environment for building end-to-end analysis pipelines with automated report generation for next generation sequence (NGS) applications such as RNA-Seq, ChIP-Seq, VAR-Seq and many others. Detailed examples for using systemPipeRdata are given in systemPipeR's overview vignette.
